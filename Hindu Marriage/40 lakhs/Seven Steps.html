    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Saptapadi, or the Seven Steps, is a crucial part of the wedding ceremony where the couple takes seven steps together, each representing a vow they make to each other. 
    This ritual signifies their commitment to support and love one another throughout their lives. 
    As they take each step, they recite promises related to love, fidelity, and companionship. 
    This moment is often filled with emotion, as it marks the couple's transition into married life.</p>
