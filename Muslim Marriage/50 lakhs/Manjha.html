    <h1> Manjha</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Manjha is the Muslim marriage equivalent of the haldi ceremony. It takes place two days before the wedding. The bride and groom wear yellow clothing in their respective homes and get smeared with a paste of turmeric and sandalwood in rosewater. There are some celebrations that are being followed, and then they are bathed in holy water. They are not supposed to leave their respective homes until the marriage day.</p>
