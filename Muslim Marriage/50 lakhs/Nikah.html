    <h1> Nikah</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is the primary wedding ritual performed by a Maulvi. The men sit around the groom and the women sit around the bride. The bride’s father is the Wali of the bride. The groom’s family offers her Mehr to seek her consent. Prayers from the Quran are recited by the Maulvi.</p>
    <p>The process begins with a marriage proposal and acceptance between the bride and groom, often facilitated by their families. The groom then offers a Mahr (dowry), a mandatory gift to the bride as a symbol of responsibility and love. The Nikah ceremony is officiated by an Imam or religious authority, where a Khutbah (sermon) is delivered, highlighting the importance of marriage in Islam. The couple then formally exchange Ijab (offer) and Qubool (acceptance) in the presence of at least two witnesses. Once both agree, they sign the Nikah Nama (marriage contract), making the union legally and religiously valid. The ceremony concludes with Dua (prayers) for blessings, followed by a Walima (wedding feast), hosted by the groom’s family to celebrate the marriage.</p>
