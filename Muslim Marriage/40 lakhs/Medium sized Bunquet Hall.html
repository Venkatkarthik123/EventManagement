    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        A medium-sized budget hall is an affordable yet well-equipped venue for events such as weddings, engagements, corporate meetings, and social gatherings. These halls typically offer decent seating capacity, accommodating 100 to 300 guests, and come with essential amenities like basic d√©cor, lighting, sound systems, and catering services. While not as extravagant as luxury banquet halls, they often feature air conditioning, stage setups, and parking facilities, ensuring a comfortable experience for guests. Many budget-friendly halls also allow custom decorations and external catering, providing flexibility based on individual preferences.
