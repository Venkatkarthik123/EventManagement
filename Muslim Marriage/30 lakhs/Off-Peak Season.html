    <h1>Off-Peak Season</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>Cost Savings:</h2> Planning the event during off-peak seasons (typically outside of wedding season or major holidays) can significantly reduce costs for venues and services.<br>
        <h2>Availability:</h2> Greater availability of venues, decorators, and catering services, allowing for more flexibility in planning.<br>
        <h2>Less Stress:</h2> Reduced competition for resources and services, leading to a more relaxed planning process.<br>
        <h2>Intimate Experience:</h2> Off-peak events often have a more intimate feel, as there are fewer events happening simultaneously.
