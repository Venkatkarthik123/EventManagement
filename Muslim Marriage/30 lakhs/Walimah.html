    <h1>Walimah</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The Walimah, also known as Dawat-e-dalimah, is the second post-wedding ritual of a Muslim wedding. It is a lavish wedding banquet that is usually hosted by the groom’s family. Immediate and distant relatives, friends, and even neighbors are invited to the feast. It is a grand wedding reception that is organized for the newlyweds to wish them a happy married life.

        If you’re new to the scene, you might think you’re at a festival. There is an endless supply of food and lots of music and dancing. Sweet drinks are also shared. Although it is a celebration, the Muslim culture frowns upon the consumption of alcohol.
