    <h1> Nikah</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        The major wedding ceremony ritual is the Nikah ceremony. It is during the Nikah that the marriage would be solemnized. Depending on the couple and their families, the ceremony can either be a grand affair or an intimate one with just the immediate family members present to bear witness. </p>

    <p>During the ceremony, the women sit and surround the bride while the men surround the groom. The Iman or Maulvi then reads some verses from the Quran and recites a prayer of blessing for the couple. After this, the Maulvi asks the bride if she consents to the marriage. If she agrees, she replies by saying “Quubool Hai”, which translates to “I do”,  three times. The same is repeated for the groom. </p>
